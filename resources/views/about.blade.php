                Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) is an apex body in India for addressing the scientific advances in the field of biomedical research. Currently, ICMR comprises of 26 research institutes catering to different areas of health research. ICMR can push biomedical science forward by sharing access to state-of-the-art facilities and resources available at the institutes under ICMR.
                <br><br>
                <b>Medical Equipments Repository Facility (MERF) </b> is a platform to search, track and manage the medical equipment’s of the 26 institutes of ICMR which are operated and maintained by a dedicated and qualified group of Scientists and Engineers. The purpose of establishing this facility is to provide easy access to these equipment’s and their management to the scientific community for advanced research. It also facilitates operation of sophisticated equipment’s located in various regions and thus helps in providing the required training to the users at appropriate time. It also caters as a robust reporting system to maintain the stock and increasing the utilization of equipment’s by sharing them. It improves the traceability and gives the detailed information about the equipment present in any institute, through attributes like manufacturer and model number.
                <br><br>
                <b>MERF</b> has been established as a joint effort of the team <b><u>Bvptechies</u></b>, <b><u>Dr. Rajni Kant (Scientist ‘F’ and Head, ICMR)</u></b> & <b><u>Dr. Meenakshi Sharma (Scientist ‘F’, ICMR)</u></b>. It was initially pitched as a problem statement at Smart India Hackathon 2017 which was a Government of India first ever initiative to solve the real world problems faced by various ministries. This provides feasibility in long run to keep the central institute as well as government updated about every instrument and its status in the institute.
